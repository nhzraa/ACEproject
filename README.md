# ACEproject
This project is a localhost project, designed for Acid Cubic Enterprise during the diploma internship period. It is completed with a basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) function. The company could easily refer to the system regarding the pricelists of the items, and the details of the staff and their suppliers. The pricelist of the items is protected with MicroProtector, in which any unauthorized person could not manipulate the URL of the localhost to get into the system, hence making it more secure.
